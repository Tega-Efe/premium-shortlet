  // Auto-calculate pricing based on booking option
  const calculatedPricePerNight = pricePerNight || 
    (formData.bookingOption === 'one-room' ? 25000 : 45000);
  const totalPrice = calculatedPricePerNight * formData.numberOfNights;
  
  const booking: SimplifiedBooking = {
    // ... other fields
    pricing: {
      pricePerNight: calculatedPricePerNight,
      totalPrice: totalPrice
    },

    createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
  };
  // Save to Firestore
}
```

#### Interface Updates

  const newStatus = !this.isApartmentAvailable();

  await this.simplifiedBookingService.toggleApartmentAvailability(
    newStatus,
    message,
    this.adminName
  ).toPromise();
  
  this.notificationService.success(`Apartment marked as ${newStatus ? 'available' : 'unavailable'}`);

  options: [], // Load from ApartmentManagementService.getAvailableApartments()
  order: 1 // Before booking option
}
```

**Steps**:
1. Add apartment selector field to booking form
2. Load available apartments on form init
3. Update `SimplifiedBooking` interface to include `apartmentId?: string`

```typescript
// Add to SimplifiedBooking interface
interface SimplifiedBooking {
  // ... existing fields
  apartmentId?: string;
  apartmentTitle?: string;
  // ... rest of fields
}
```
