# Admin Security Implementation - Quick Reference

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Single Device Login** 🔐
- Only ONE device can be logged in at a time
- Logging in from a new device automatically logs out the previous device
- Real-time session monitoring via Firestore

### 2. **Inactivity Auto-Logout** ⏰
- Automatically logs out after **15 minutes** of inactivity
- Monitors: mouse movements, keyboard, scrolling, touches
- Shows alert before logout

### 3. **Route Change Auto-Logout** 🚪
- Navigating away from `/admin` automatically logs out
- Protects against accidental navigation
- Prevents session hijacking

### 4. **Login Page Protection** 🛡️
- Already-logged-in admins cannot access `/admin/login`
- Redirects authenticated users to dashboard
- Prevents duplicate login attempts

### 5. **Session Tracking** 📊
- All sessions stored in Firestore `admin-sessions` collection
- Tracks device info, login time, last activity
- Enables audit trail

## 📋 Next Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Firestore Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Step 2: Test the Features

**Test Single Device Login:**
```
1. Open Chrome → Login to admin
2. Open Firefox → Login with same credentials
3. Chrome should show alert and logout
```

**Test Inactivity:**
```
1. Login to admin
2. Wait 15 minutes without touching mouse/keyboard
3. Should auto-logout with alert
```

**Test Route Change:**
```
1. Login to admin
2. Navigate to "/" or "/home" in address bar
3. Should auto-logout immediately
```

**Test Login Page Protection:**
```
1. Login to admin
2. Type "/admin/login" in address bar
3. Should redirect back to /admin
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Change Inactivity Timeout
File: `src/app/core/auth/services/admin-auth.service.ts` (Line ~53)

```typescript
// Current: 15 minutes
private readonly INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT = 15 * 60 * 1000;

// Examples:
private readonly INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT = 5 * 60 * 1000;   // 5 minutes
private readonly INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT = 30 * 60 * 1000;  // 30 minutes
```

### Disable Route Change Logout
Comment out line 65 in `admin-auth.service.ts`:
```typescript
// this.initRouteListener();
```

---

## 🔍 How It Works

### Single Device Login Flow:
```
1. User A logs in → Creates session with ID "xyz123"
2. Firestore stores session document
3. Real-time listener watches session document
4. User B logs in → Creates new session with ID "abc456"
5. User A's listener detects session ID changed
6. User A automatically logged out with alert
```

### Inactivity Detection Flow:
```
1. User logs in → Start 15-minute timer
2. User moves mouse → Reset timer to 15 minutes
3. User types → Reset timer
4. No activity for 15 minutes → Timer expires
5. Alert shown → Auto logout
```

### Route Change Flow:
```
1. User on /admin/bookings
2. User navigates to /home
3. Route listener detects navigation
4. URL doesn't start with /admin
5. Trigger logout
```

## 📊 Firestore Structure

Collection: `admin-sessions`

```javascript
Document ID: {userId}  // Firebase Auth UID

{
  userId: "abc123xyz",
  sessionId: "session_1698765432_x7k2m9p",
  deviceInfo: "Windows - Mozilla/5.0...",
  lastActivity: Timestamp(2025-10-30 14:23:15),
  loginTime: Timestamp(2025-10-30 13:45:00),
  isActive: true
}
```

---

## 🔒 Security Rules

```javascript
match /admin-sessions/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
                     && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

**Protection:**
- ✅ Only authenticated users
- ✅ Users can only access their own session
- ✅ Cannot read/modify other users' sessions

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Browser Refresh**: ✅ Maintains session, continues monitoring
2. **Multiple Tabs**: ✅ Same session, shared monitoring
3. **Remember Me**: ✅ Works with all security features
4. **Manual Logout**: ✅ Still works via "Sign Out" button

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Not logging out on inactivity?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT value
- Ensure event listeners are attached

### Multiple devices staying logged in?
- Deploy Firestore rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
- Check session document in Firestore console
- Verify real-time listener is working

### Getting logged out too often?
- Increase INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT
- Check if route listener is triggering incorrectly
